            <p>How do wind turbines and solar panels work together in a renewable energy system?</p>
            <p>
              Wind turbines and solar panels generate electricity through different mechanisms. Wind
              turbines harness the kinetic energy of the wind to turn blades, which then drive a
              generator. Solar panels convert sunlight into electricity through the photovoltaic
              effect. When integrated into a renewable energy system, these technologies complement
              each other by providing a continuous and reliable power supply. Wind power is often
              more abundant during certain times, while solar power is consistent during daylight
              hours, resulting in a more stable overall energy output.
